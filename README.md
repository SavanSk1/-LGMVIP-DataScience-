Iris Flower Claasification ML Project

TASK # 1

To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning From the given ‘Iris’ dataset,we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
